## Development

### Installing System Dependencies

```
brew install yarn
brew install postgresql
```

We chose to use Yarn as a replacement for npm. It's faster and *guarantees* consistency -- as we deploy in various environments, we don't run the risk of slight variations in what gets installed.

### Install Project Dependencies

```
yarn global add grunt-cli knex eslint
```


## Database Initialization

IMPORTANT: ensure `postgres` is running before performing these steps.

### Database Creation:

Use grunt to create a new database for development and test environments:

Development envronment: `grunt pgcreatedb:default`


### Run Migrations & Data Seeds

In terminal, from the root directory:

To migrate to the latest version, run:

`yarn migrate`

To rollback a version, run:

`yarn rollback`

To populate the database with seed data, run:

`yarn seed`

Note: scripts are set up in package.json for these knex commands.

## Running the App

To run webpack build: `yarn build`

To run server: `yarn start`

To run tests: `yarn test`

To run your redis server for the session store `redis-server`
